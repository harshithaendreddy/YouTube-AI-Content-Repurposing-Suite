## üìñ Introduction

In an increasingly global world, a vast amount of valuable information on platforms like YouTube remains locked behind language barriers. The **YouTube AI Content Repurposing Suite** was built to solve this problem by creating a seamless, multi-modal content transformation pipeline.

Users can simply provide a YouTube link and instantly receive the video's content as a readable transcript, a translated document in one of several supported languages, and a high-quality audio file for on-the-go listening. This project demonstrates a practical application of API integration and automated content processing to create a high-value tool for students, professionals, and content creators worldwide.
