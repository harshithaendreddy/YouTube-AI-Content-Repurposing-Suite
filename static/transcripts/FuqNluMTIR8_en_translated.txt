hey there my name is Demitri and in this video we're going to dive into the three simple hacks that you can use to get a YouTube video transcript and summarize it and what I often struggle with is the fact that there's a lot of really great information in YouTube videos but unfortunately it can be kind of difficult to wrap your head around it when it's all verbal and visual and sometimes you just want to have different components written out so that you can actually give advice to other people or remind yourself of key specific points from a YouTube video that were valuable and with AI nowadays you can really summarize it pretty easily if you have the text but getting the text is kind of hard so the first way that you can actually get this transcript generator is with a Chrome extension called YouTube summary with chat GPT and Claude I have it installed on my account and you'll see on the right hand side all it is is a very simple and easy to interact with Chrome extension if I click on summarize video here it actually opens up my chat GPT account and will ask it to take the transcript and summarize it which is really cool but for just the transcript it actually is just right here it has timestamps where if I click on the different parts of the video you'll see that I pop over right to 3 minutes and 21 seconds or back over to 42 seconds and there are bits of text showcasing what I said and I'm easily able to search through it jump to the current time or copy the transcript into plain text and ask for this summarize this YouTube video on chat GPT or whatever product I want now there is a premium version with the summary option here that you can use but I can simply just use chat gbt and you'll see that the summary comes out really quick which is nice so that's a very easy way to do it if you like it from a Chrome extension standpoint but if you're looking for a solution that's a little bit different where you can go to a website and get the transcripts you can actually go to tactic. and use the YouTube transcript tool to get a video transcript and you'll notice that it breaks it down actually a lot better uh the time stamps on this are much more robust it's kind of broken down into each section and I can click through to go to any of these time stamps and basically every sentence and phrase it breaks it down in very short intervals as you can see they're like more closer to 5 10 seconds whereas this product was more like 30 to 40 seconds so this is a much more robust tool you can copy it out or even download the transcript very easily and it's able to be put but in right here and what's really cool about that is using tactics upload feature you can actually take that and add it to a place where you store these transcripts and what's great about tactic is it doesn't only transcribe YouTube videos it also takes your meetings transcribes them and allows you to analyze them with AI you can customize workflows so that after your meetings a sequence of AI prompts will give you the answers that you want to the questions you have about your meeting and then then send follow-ups to team members and share that information with anyone you'd like if you want to learn more about tactic you can get started by trying our free Chrome extension so make sure to go to tactic to add the free Chrome extension to your browser today to get started transcribing your meetings now last but not least you may not want a full AI transcript and just want a quick summary what I'm going to do is go to note gpio and then paste the link in here and then click generate summary and while this will provide a transcript in a nice format similar to 30 40 seconds as the other one it also for free does have a summary in a very nice formatted manner uh in comparison to this product it's not inside of it but it does have a free summary tool if you want to pay for the feature to have mind map or AI chat you absolutely can and this product actually has an entire workspace component to it as well it's a really cool product just a quick and easy copy and paste and similarly has a lot of the same components as well well as some new ones so if you're interested in trying out any of these three products to transcribe your YouTube videos and get that YouTube video transcript make sure to click any of the links down below to try them out today with that being said thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one
