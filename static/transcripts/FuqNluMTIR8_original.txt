hey there my name is Demitri and in this video 
we're going to dive into the three simple hacks   that you can use to get a YouTube video transcript 
and summarize it and what I often struggle with   is the fact that there's a lot of really great 
information in YouTube videos but unfortunately it   can be kind of difficult to wrap your head around 
it when it's all verbal and visual and sometimes   you just want to have different components written 
out so that you can actually give advice to other   people or remind yourself of key specific points 
from a YouTube video that were valuable and with   AI nowadays you can really summarize it pretty 
easily if you have the text but getting the text   is kind of hard so the first way that you can 
actually get this transcript generator is with   a Chrome extension called YouTube summary with 
chat GPT and Claude I have it installed on my   account and you'll see on the right hand side 
all it is is a very simple and easy to interact   with Chrome extension if I click on summarize 
video here it actually opens up my chat GPT   account and will ask it to take the transcript and 
summarize it which is really cool but for just the   transcript it actually is just right here it has 
timestamps where if I click on the different parts   of the video you'll see that I pop over right to 3 
minutes and 21 seconds or back over to 42 seconds   and there are bits of text showcasing what I said 
and I'm easily able to search through it jump   to the current time or copy the transcript into 
plain text and ask for this summarize this YouTube   video on chat GPT or whatever product I want now 
there is a premium version with the summary option   here that you can use but I can simply just use 
chat gbt and you'll see that the summary comes   out really quick which is nice so that's a very 
easy way to do it if you like it from a Chrome   extension standpoint but if you're looking for a 
solution that's a little bit different where you   can go to a website and get the transcripts you 
can actually go to tactic. and use the YouTube   transcript tool to get a video transcript and 
you'll notice that it breaks it down actually   a lot better uh the time stamps on this are much 
more robust it's kind of broken down into each   section and I can click through to go to any of 
these time stamps and basically every sentence and   phrase it breaks it down in very short intervals 
as you can see they're like more closer to 5 10   seconds whereas this product was more like 30 to 
40 seconds so this is a much more robust tool you   can copy it out or even download the transcript 
very easily and it's able to be put but in right   here and what's really cool about that is using 
tactics upload feature you can actually take   that and add it to a place where you store these 
transcripts and what's great about tactic is it   doesn't only transcribe YouTube videos it also 
takes your meetings transcribes them and allows   you to analyze them with AI you can customize 
workflows so that after your meetings a sequence   of AI prompts will give you the answers that you 
want to the questions you have about your meeting   and then then send follow-ups to team members and 
share that information with anyone you'd like if   you want to learn more about tactic you can get 
started by trying our free Chrome extension so   make sure to go to tactic to add the free Chrome 
extension to your browser today to get started   transcribing your meetings now last but not least 
you may not want a full AI transcript and just   want a quick summary what I'm going to do is go 
to note gpio and then paste the link in here and   then click generate summary and while this will 
provide a transcript in a nice format similar to   30 40 seconds as the other one it also for free 
does have a summary in a very nice formatted   manner uh in comparison to this product it's not 
inside of it but it does have a free summary tool   if you want to pay for the feature to have mind 
map or AI chat you absolutely can and this product   actually has an entire workspace component to it 
as well it's a really cool product just a quick   and easy copy and paste and similarly has a lot of 
the same components as well well as some new ones   so if you're interested in trying out any of these 
three products to transcribe your YouTube videos   and get that YouTube video transcript make sure
