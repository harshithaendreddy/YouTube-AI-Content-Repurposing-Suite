hey hello everyone in this video I'll be 
showing you how to use Gemini AI API with   python so let's get started so first thing is 
just Google Gemini AI API you'll be getting   this link ai. gooogle dot dev just click this 
and you'll be getting the build with Gemini   interface like this and if you haven't signed 
in you need to click on sign in and sign in   with your Google account so once you have done 
that just click on get API key in Google AI studio so this is the interface that we'll be 
getting and to the right we'll be having a model   so at the moment we are currently having only 
Gemini 1.0 Pro and in case if you want to get   a sample demo of the response here you can type 
something so I'll just go with essay on AI and if   I click this we'll be getting a sample response 
from Gemini 1.0 pro model this is a response   that I'm getting and in case if you want to see 
the documentation to the left you'll be having   this documentation over here so here you can just 
go to Python and you'll be having a sample code   over here now let's just begin to code so I'll 
just go to my studio and to the topmost right   you'll be having this get code if I click this 
this will have a sample code for curl request   JavaScript python Android cine and Swift and if I 
click JavaScript I'll be getting the code and for   python we are having additional option as open 
in collab so if I click this we'll be getting   an collab space over here and we can even run our 
code and check over here so we just need to plug   in our API key over here and we can just run and 
get our output so this is one way of running the   code in Python the second way is going to be just 
copying this code just copy this and let me go to   my visual studio code I will just create a new 
file and let me just paste the code over here   and we'll be adding our API key over here so for 
getting the API key to the left we'll be having   a get API key option click this and this is fine 
just click on okay we need to click on create API   key so in case if you don't have any existing 
projects you'll be having here option called   as create API key you can just click there and 
create I'm having some existing project so I'll   just click my project and click on create API 
key in existing project so this is my API key   I'll just copy this close it and in case if you 
don't want the API key you can just delete it in   case if you feel it's compromised or something 
I'll just go to my code and inside double quotes   I will just paste my API key like this so now we 
are done adding the API key and the next thing   that we need to do is we need to install this 
particular python package so here it says right   pip install Google generative AI so if you go here 
to that package you'll be getting a sample code   also you can just read it through so I'll just do 
this just copy this and paste it in my terminal   yeah that's it so this is good and here we can 
make some changes for example we can change the   maximum output tokens and the safety settings we 
are passing the model name the generation config   and safety settings to this generative model 
object and we are getting a variable there model   and with that we are starting our conversation and 
here you remember right I gave a prompt essay on   here right this saves our chat history over here 
so basically we don't need this at all at this   moment so if you want you can just remove this if 
you want you can just have the chat history maybe   in case if you're using like you can just store 
it inside this list in my case in this demo I   don't need that so I'm just removing it and here 
we will be typing our prompt so I'll just go with   the same topic essay on AI and we're just printing 
it last. text so this is the code basically I'll   just save it and I'll will clear my console and 
run it for running it it's going to be python   space your file name. py and make sure that you 
have already installed and configured python on   your system so this is the response that I get 
so literally it's such a big essay that we are   getting and in case if you want to minimize the 
number of words that is getting generated you   can go here and change this maximum output tokens 
you can just minimize the value over here so this   is basically how you run and use Gemini AI API 
in Python I hope you would have found this video   useful do check the playlist of my channel I have 
done a lot of videos in openAI API programming   Gemini AI as well as other AI videos also check 
the playlist subscribe me thanks for watching
